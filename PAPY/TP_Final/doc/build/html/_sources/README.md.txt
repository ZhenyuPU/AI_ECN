When creating a new project, it is crucial to write a clear and comprehensive README file. Here is a possible example of a README document for the Mandelbrot_Julia_Plot project:

# Mandelbrot_Julia_Plot

Mandelbrot_Julia_Plot is a Python project for generating Mandelbrot and Julia set images.

## Features

- Generate Mandelbrot set images.
- Generate Julia set images.
- Customize image details, including complex value ranges, pixel size, and maximum iteration count.
- Support custom image generation using command-line parameters.

## Installation

You can easily install the Mandelbrot_Julia_Plot project using the following command:

```shell
pip install Mandelbrot_Julia_Plot
```

## Usage Examples

Generate a default Mandelbrot set image:

```shell
MandelbrotPlot -o mandelbrot.png
```

Generate a default Julia set image:

```shell
JuliaPlot -o julia.png
```

Customize image generation, for example, a Mandelbrot set:

```shell
MandelbrotPlot --zmin=-2-2j --zmax=2+2j --pixel_size=5e-4 --max_iter=50 -o "Mandelbrot_custom.png"
```
